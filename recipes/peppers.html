    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Chop enough reserved green pepper tops to equal 1/4 cup; set aside. Discard remaining tops or use for
            another purpose.</li>
        <li>Place hollowed-out green peppers in a microwave-safe dish; cover and cook in microwave until bright green
            and steaming, about 3 minutes. Set peppers aside.</li>
        <li>
            Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet with onion and 1/4 cup chopped pepper tops over medium heat until
            beef is browned, the juices run clear, and the onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour in diced tomatoes with their juice, rice, water, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper; bring to
            a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover skillet, and simmer until rice is tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
            Stir Cheddar cheese into ground beef-rice mixture and spoon mixture into precooked peppers. Set peppers
            upright in an 8x8-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and peppers are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
